## Election-Audit Summary
#### The script written for this project was successfully used to analyze the data provided for the Congressional election. The same script, with some modifications, could be used for other congressional elections or even larger elections.  
#### One example is for the results of a statewide election, such as for the Governor. In this case, you may want to see the data broken down by both county and city.  We could provide the analysis by city by replicating the process we created for the county data.
#### Another example that this script could be used for a city election for Mayor.  In this case, we wouln't need the county data, so that could be removed.
